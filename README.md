## Motivation

MUD files are plain text files in JSON format that contain ACL rules for a device. A MUD file can contains tens or hundrends of ACL rules which makes it difficult to read and validate the files manually. mud-visualizer will help you to read and validate (and modify in near future) the MUD files.  

## Installation

Use the following commands to install and run `mud-visualizer`: 

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/iot-onboarding/mud-visualizer
$ cd mud-visualizer
$ npm install

## Supported MUD Abstractions

Currently the following MUD abstractions are supported in both `incoming` and `outgoing` traffic directions: 

- `domain-names`
- `local-networks`
- `same-manufacturer`
- `manufacturer`
- `my-controller`
